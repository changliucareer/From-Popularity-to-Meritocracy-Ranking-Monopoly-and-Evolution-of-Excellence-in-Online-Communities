# Abstract
Helpfulnessvotesarethe currency of evaluation on online platforms. To assess information quality, service providers enable users to cast binary votes—such as “helpful” or “not helpful”—based on their judgments of individual responses like customer reviews of products and expert answers to questions. While these votes aim to represent the excellence of information in aggregate, valuable responses may not receive proper attention due to biases inherent in voting process. By investigating the influence of position and herding biases along with their monopolistic reinforcement, we propose the Evolution of Excellence (EoE), a theoretical framework that explains the cascading dynamics of online evaluations in assessing interrelated responses. To quantify these biases, we map the diverse voting behaviors across 120 major StackExchange communities onto two behavioral axes, further clustering the communities into four distinct information categories. We also demonstrate the behavioral evolution of individual communities over the years, highlighting longitudinal insights into the underlying social process. Designing novel metrics to quantify information monopoly, our findings can help service providers secure community-specific insights and interventions that promote meritocracy.
